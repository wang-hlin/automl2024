**[Documentation](https://syne-tune.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)** | **[Tutorials](https://syne-tune.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/basics/README.html)** | **[API Reference](https://syne-tune.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_apidoc/modules.html#)** | **[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/syne-tune)** | **[Latest Blog Post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/hyperparameter-optimization-for-fine-tuning-pre-trained-transformer-models-from-hugging-face/)**

Syne Tune provides state-of-the-art algorithms for hyperparameter optimization (HPO) with the following key features:
* **Lightweight and platform-agnostic**: Syne Tune is designed to work with
  different execution backends, so you are not locked into a particular
  distributed system architecture. Syne Tune runs with minimal dependencies.
* **Wide coverage of different HPO methods**: Syne Tune supports more than 20 different optimization methods across [multi-fidelity HPO](https://syne-tune.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/multifidelity/README.html), [constrained HPO](https://syne-tune.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/basics/basics_outlook.html#further-topics), [multi-objective HPO](https://syne-tune.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#supported-multi-objective-optimization-methods), [transfer learning](https://syne-tune.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/transfer_learning/transfer_learning.html), [cost-aware HPO](https://syne-tune.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_apidoc/syne_tune.optimizer.schedulers.searchers.cost_aware.html), and [population-based training](https://syne-tune.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_apidoc/syne_tune.optimizer.schedulers.pbt.html).
* **Simple, modular design**: Rather than wrapping other HPO
  frameworks, Syne Tune provides simple APIs and scheduler templates, which can
  easily be [extended to your specific needs](https://syne-tune.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/developer/README.html).
  Studying the code will allow you to understand what the different algorithms
  are doing, and how they differ from each other.
* **Industry-strength Bayesian optimization**: Syne Tune has comprehensive support
  for [Gaussian Process-based Bayesian optimization](https://syne-tune.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/basics/basics_bayesopt.html).
  The same code powers modalities such as multi-fidelity HPO, constrained HPO, and
  cost-aware HPO, and has been tried and tested in production for several years.
* **Support for distributed workloads**: Syne Tune lets you move fast, thanks to the parallel compute resources AWS SageMaker offers. Syne Tune allows ML/AI practitioners to easily set up and run studies with many [experiments running in parallel](https://syne-tune.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/experimentation/README.html). Run on different compute environments (locally, AWS, simulation) by changing just one line of code.
* **Out-of-the-box tabulated benchmarks:** Tabulated benchmarks let you simulate results in seconds while preserving the real dynamics of asynchronous or synchronous HPO with any number of workers.


Syne Tune is developed in collaboration with the team behind the [Automatic Model Tuning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/automatic-model-tuning.html) service.


## Installing

To install Syne Tune from pip, you can simply do:

```bash
pip install 'syne-tune[basic]'
```

or to install the latest version from source: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/awslabs/syne-tune.git
cd syne-tune
python3 -m venv st_venv
. st_venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e '.[basic]'
```

This installs everything in a virtual environment `st_venv`. Remember to activate
this environment before working with Syne Tune. We also recommend building the
virtual environment from scratch now and then, in particular when you pull a new
release, as dependencies may have changed.

See our [change log](CHANGELOG.md) to see what changed in the latest version. 

## Getting started

To enable tuning, you have to report metrics from a training script so that they can be communicated later to Syne Tune,
this can be accomplished by just calling `report(epoch=epoch, loss=loss)` as shown in the example below:

```python
# train_height_simple.py
import logging
import time

from syne_tune import Reporter
from argparse import ArgumentParser

if __name__ == '__main__':
    root = logging.getLogger()
    root.setLevel(logging.INFO)
    parser = ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument('--epochs', type=int)
    parser.add_argument('--width', type=float)
    parser.add_argument('--height', type=float)
    args, _ = parser.parse_known_args()
    report = Reporter()
    for step in range(args.epochs):
        time.sleep(0.1)
        dummy_score = 1.0 / (0.1 + args.width * step / 100) + args.height * 0.1
        # Feed the score back to Syne Tune.
        report(epoch=step + 1, mean_loss=dummy_score)
```

Once you have a training script reporting a metric, you can launch a tuning as follows:

```python
# launch_height_simple.py
from syne_tune import Tuner, StoppingCriterion
from syne_tune.backend import LocalBackend
from syne_tune.config_space import randint
from syne_tune.optimizer.baselines import ASHA

# hyperparameter search space to consider
config_space = {
    'width': randint(1, 20),
    'height': randint(1, 20),
    'epochs': 100,
}

tuner = Tuner(
    trial_backend=LocalBackend(entry_point='train_height_simple.py'),
    scheduler=ASHA(
        config_space,
        metric='mean_loss',
        resource_attr='epoch',
        max_resource_attr="epochs",
        search_options={'debug_log': False},
    ),
    stop_criterion=StoppingCriterion(max_wallclock_time=30),
    n_workers=4,  # how many trials are evaluated in parallel
)
tuner.run()
```

The above example runs ASHA with 4 asynchronous workers on a local machine.

## Experimentation with Syne Tune

If you plan to use advanced features of Syne Tune, such as different execution
backends or running experiments remotely, writing launcher scripts like
`examples/launch_height_simple.py` can become tedious. Syne Tune provides an
advanced experimentation framework, which you can learn about in
[this tutorial](https://syne-tune.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/experimentation/README.html)
or also in
[this one](https://syne-tune.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/odsc_tutorial/README.html).

The following hyperparameter optimization (HPO) methods are available in Syne Tune:

Method | Reference | Searcher | Asynchronous? | Multi-fidelity? | Transfer?

REA | Real, et al. (2019) | evolutionary | yes | no | no 
KDE | Falkner, et al. (2018) | model-based | yes | no | no 
PBT | Jaderberg, et al. (2017) | evolutionary | no | yes | no 
ZeroShotTransfer | Wistuba, et al. (2015) | deterministic | yes | no | yes

<sup>*</sup>: We implement the model-based scheduling logic of DyHPO, but use
the same Gaussian process surrogate models as MOBSTER and HyperTune. The original
source code for the paper is [here](https://github.com/releaunifreiburg/DyHPO/tree/main).

The searchers fall into four broad categories, **deterministic**, **random**, **evolutionary** and **model-based**. The random searchers sample candidate hyperparameter configurations uniformly at random, while the model-based searchers sample them non-uniformly at random, according to a model (e.g., Gaussian process, density ration estimator, etc.) and an acquisition function. The evolutionary searchers make use of an evolutionary algorithm.

Syne Tune also supports [BoTorch](https://github.com/awslabs/syne-tune/blob/main/syne_tune/optimizer/schedulers/searchers/botorch/botorch_searcher.py) searchers.

## Supported multi-objective optimization methods

Method |          Reference          |   Searcher   | Asynchronous? | Multi-fidelity? | Transfer?
:--- |:---------------------------:|:------------:| :---: | :---: | :---: 
Constrained Bayesian Optimization |   Gardner, et al. (2014)    | model-based  | yes | no | no
MOASHA |  Schmucker, et al. (2021)   |    random    | yes | yes | no
NSGA-2 |     Deb, et al. (2002)      | evolutionary | no | no | no
Multi Objective Multi Surrogate (MSMOS) | Guerrero-Viu, et al. (2021) | model-based  | no | no | no
MSMOS wihh random scalarization |    Paria, et al. (2018)     | model-based  | no | no | no

HPO methods listed can be used in a multi-objective setting by scalarization or non-dominated sorting. See [multiobjective_priority.py](syne_tune/optimizer/schedulers/multiobjective/multiobjective_priority.py) for details.
